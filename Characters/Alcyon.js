    etymology:
      `<h1>Name</h1>
      <p>
      <strong>Alcyon</strong><br>
      <i>/al.see.on/ [ˈæl.saɪ.ɒn]</i><br><br>

      The name "Alcyon" comes from the tragic tale of Alcyone and her husband who were punished by Zeus, eventually becoming the first halcyon birds, songbirds with mournful songs. This was chosen because she and her lusus were originally based on Sirin and Alkonost, legendary woman-headed birds in Slavic folklore aka the birds of joy and sorrow.<br><br>
      
      <strong>Alcyon</strong><br>
      <i>/lie.der/ [ˈliː.dər]</i><br><br>
      
      Her surname, "Lieder" comes from the German term "Lied," which refers to setting poetry to classical music, creating polyphonic compositions and is often also used interchangeably with the term "art song." I landed on this due to Alcyon's connection to poetry and music.<br><br>

      Paired together it's obvious why I chose these for Alcyon's name, between her secret intrest in music and song and her connection to the mythical Sirin and Alkonost i think this was the perfect name for her.
