    etymology:
      `<h1>Name</h1>
      <p>
      <strong>Alcyon</strong><br>
      <i>/al.see.on/</i><br><br>

      The name "Alcyon" comes from the tragic tale of Alcyone and her husband who were punished by Zeus, eventually becoming the first halcyon birds, songbirds with mournful songs. This was chosen because she and her lusus were originally based on Sirin and Alkonost, legendary woman-headed birds in Slavic folklore aka the birds of joy and sorrow.<br><br>
      
      <strong>Alcyon</strong><br>
      <i>/lie.der/</i><br><br>
      
      Her surname, "Lieder" comes from the German term "Lied," which refers to setting poetry to classical music, creating polyphonic compositions and is often also used interchangeably with the term "art song." I landed on this due to Alcyon's connection to poetry and music.<br><br>

      Paired together it's obvious why I chose these for Alcyon's name, between her secret intrest in music and song and her connection to the mythical Sirin and Alkonost i think this was the perfect name for her.

      biography: 
      `<h1>Bio</h1>
      <p>
      A shy, nervous, and cautious troll, that strives to be a model citizen in hopes that she will blend into the crowd and earn acceptance from her peers. Despite her efforts to not stand out, she finds herself becoming a punching bag and the subject of jokes within her circles though that's due to her sensitivity. She's only truly afraid of being mocked and picked at in earnest so she can roll with the punches until that point.<br><br>

      Alcyon is a fan of the adorable often reading fashion magazines, painting her nails with little white feathers, braiding her lusus's hair, and meticulously planning cute outfits weeks in advance. She even hosts tea parties with one of her only true friends, another tealblood troll named "Myrdin", though it could be argued that she wouldn't be doing this if it weren't for the fact that it's a means to prevent Myrdin from bringing harm onto others. Her room contains many stuffed animals and even a doll that Myrdin made her.<br><br>

      Alcyon engages in various interests but lacks the drive to pursue most of them beyond a basic level whether it be due to a  lack of confidence, fear of failure, or laziness. Despite being mostly quiet about her interests in public, Alcyon expresses herself through activities like playing the harp or piano, singing, sewing,  and knitting, these activities becoming a source of solace for Alcyon, providing an escape from the harsh and judgmental world she lives in. While Alcyon is scared of being judged herself,  underneath the surface, she actually holds judgments of others. However, her shyness, nervousness, and social awkwardness prevent her from expressing these judgments openly.
