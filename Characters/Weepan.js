    etymology:
      `<h1 style="color: #d11d05;">Name</h1>

      <strong>Weepan</strong><br>
      <i>/'we-pan/</i><br><br>

      Weepan comes from Old English word "wepan," meaning to shed tears, cry, bewail, mourn over, or complain. The addition of an extra e was to make it fit the six letter naming template. I think that this name really fits her due to things that unfold within her story but it also sounds really similar to "Weapon" which I also thought really fit given her propensity to use her drumsticks as one and her potential to be one herself due to her psionics.

      <strong>Strixs</strong><br>
      <i>/Ëˆst.ricks/</i><br><br>
    
      Strixs was chosen because it well... Sounds like "sticks"... As in drumsticks... yknow...? She's a drummer... Lol. But anyway, later it gained a second meaning and is now also connected to the Strix, a bird of ill omen  that fed on human flesh and blood. This was retroactively added to her story in the form of her lusus being modeled after this creature.
