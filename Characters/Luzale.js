        <p>
        A bubbly and sweet troll, Luzale is deeply passionate about both anime and more specifically yaoi. She spends most of her time in her hive (dubbed a "wretched nest of cum and villainry" by her maid), drawing her OTPs, reading and writing steamy romantic stories, and watching anime from her favorite genres, magical girl and yaoi. Due to her NEET tendencies her bedroom is perpetually messy, much to the frustration of her rustblood maid who reluctantly has to clean up after her.<br><br>

 Proud to be an otaku, Luzale is not only an adept artist but also an active member of a doujin circle, often selling her works at troll comiket to bond with her dedicated fan base, one of the only times she ever leaves her hive. Another thing that brings Luzale out of her hive is cosplay, she loves pretending to be her favorite characters and showing off her skills at various cosplay events. Beyond yaoi, Luzale's greatest love is Troll Miku. She religiously listens to Miku's music and incorporates her into her cosplay list and dreams of meeting her in person to profess her love.<br><br>

Despite her initial shyness, she quickly warms up to those who share her passions, enthusiastically collaborating with fellow artists and writers and even engages in heated discussions online about her favorite animes, fiercely defending her faves and always ready to stand up against any criticism directed at them.
