    etymology:
      `<h1>Name</h1>
      <p>
      <strong>Yercie</strong><br>
      <i>/'yer-sea/ </i><br><br>
      I derived "Yercie" from how I pronounced Circe, but I changed up the spelling a bit and added a "Y" to it instead of an "S" because I thought it looked and sounded more interesting than "Sersea". I picked Circe because while she was a goddess she was also something of a witch who  was renowned for her vast knowledge of potions and herbs and was known to use them and a magic wand or staff to transform her enemies, or those who offended her, into animals.


      <strong>Vennun</strong><br>
      <i>/ˈven.nen/</i><br><br>
      
      Her surname, Vennun comes from the latin word for venom "venenum" I just took the second "E" out to match the six letter format and changed the "M" into an "N" to make it sound more audibly appealing and interesting. I think it's also interesting to note that I decided on making her surname reference venom (the substance) due to her involvement with Cabría and La Brujota, prominent poison makers in the witch community and because of her heavily venomous lusus.
