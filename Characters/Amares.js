    etymology:
      `<h1>Name</h1>
      <p>
      <strong>Amares</strong><br>
      <i>/'ah.mahr.ez/</i><br><br>
    
      Originally, "Amares Ossium" was proposed by my friend Jojro. Her reasoning being that in Latin "Amares" could be translated as "loving," and "Ossium" as "bones." The combination "Love Bones" reminding her of the film "Lovely Bones" but also creating the phrase "loves your bones". Amares can also find roots in Spanish (Amares' language of choice), derived from the future subjunctive conjugation of the verb "amar," meaning "to love."  Amares' caring and loving nature paired with her hedonistic tendencies I feel like embodies the profound affection and love associated with both linguistic origins.<br><br>
    
      <strong>Aelius</strong><br>
      <i>/ˈae̯.li.us/</i><br><br>
    
      This was initially considered as a potential first name for Amares but later found a more fitting place as her surname. This name originates from the Romans and possibly derived from the Greek word ἥλιος (helios), which means "sun." So the name Aelius is associated with Sunshine and brilliance, something that I believe her personality clearly demonstrates the more you speak to her.

    biography:
      `<h1>Bio</h1>
    <p>
    Amares is a chill, down-to-earth girl with a passion for the occult and the ability to predict the future through communing with spirits. She's a lover not a fighter and this is obvious given that she prefers using her powers only to keep herself out of harm's way or playfully messing with people, but recently she's had to use them to fight. Despite her mischievous streak and vanity, she's generally caring and gets along with most people thanks to her easy-going nature. Though at the bottom of the cast system of her planet Amares is seen very highly in the underground world of witches on account of her being the direct descendant of the most legendary witch to ever walk the planet, simply known as "La Brujota"
