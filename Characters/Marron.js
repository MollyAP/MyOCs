Also has a tendency to insert periods in the middle of her thoughts,  because she forgot what she was saying and thought it was time to move on, sometimes  moving  from one thought to another in the middle of a word, starting a new sentence without finishing or erasing the previous one. `,

        etymology:
            `<h1>Name</h1>
            <p>
            <strong>Marron</strong><br>
            <i>/meh.ruhn/</i><br><br>
        
            Not much thought went into naming Marron as "marron" is just the spanish word for brown... And she is a brown blood... Very creative, I know. But I think the name is very nice for her.<br><br>

            <strong>Dormir</strong><br>
            <i>/dohr.meer/</i><br><br>
            Another very well thought out very creative name! Dormir is the spanish word for "sleep" perfect for a sleepy troll like Marron. I have to pat myself on the back for this one.

        biography: 
        `<h1>Bio</h1>
        <p>
        A kind troll that usually sleeps when most trolls are awake, fooling her peers into thinking she's lazy. It's not hard to see why as when she is awake during  working hours she's verry sluggish and forgetful, often forgetting words while actively talking. Approximately 2.31 sweeps (5 years) ago, her hive was completely destroyed in an event that she NEVER talks about and Amares, her best friend since they were 6 sweeps (13 years) old took her in, leading to her current bizarre but much appreciated living arrangement of sleeping in Amares' bathtub... which explains Amares' less than frequent bathing habits.<br><br>

Despite Marron's reputation for laziness she is very active about her interests, such as filming and video editing, even playing a crucial role as Amares' camerawoman for her OnlyFiends. Marron actively engages in all of Amares' photography and filming, and handles the logistical side of Amares' career, from selecting games for streams to managing her schedule and social media. In addition to her behind-the-scenes work, Marron dabbles in arts and crafts, making trinkets and props for her less popular YouTube channel. Some of her creations ending up in Amares' videos and photos as background elements or props for cosplay.<br><br>

Marron's unique sleep schedule is actually the way it is because it's synchronized with her lusus' diurnal cycle. She loves her lusus, but is also a bit afraid of her due to her habit of eating the unkempt toenails of trolls who haven't bothered to trim them. Her childhood memories are plagued with memories of her lusus accidentally biting her toes in the process. To avoid any more surprise nibbles, Marron is diligent about keeping her and her hivemates toenails neatly trimmed.
