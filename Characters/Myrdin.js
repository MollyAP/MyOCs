        Polyamorous and quick to fall in love, Myrdin is a dollmaking witch that lives in a boot deep in the forest where she lovingly crafts dolls from scratch. While it's easy to imagine one of Myrdin's dolls in your own hive make no mistake these handcrafted trinkets aren't for sell, they're all her matesprits perfectly preserved in an ancient process binding them to dolls of their likeness. The dolls not only house the victim's organs but are also largely composed of the victim's own body. During the dating stage, Myrdin subtly collects thinks like hair, often through seemingly innocuous acts such as brushing it or plucking a few strands in their sleep, even the horns are authentic though she uses placeholder ones until she can obtain the real ones from the victims corpse.<br><br>

        Despite her tendency to fall in love with most people she encounters, Myrdin strangely only harbors platonic feelings for Alcyon, considering her a moirail given Alcyon's tendency to give her random checkups under the guise of a "teaparty" several times a week in an attempt to keep a close eye on her and ensure that she isn't engaging in new relationships, which for the most part has been successful.  Maybe it's because she doesn't think Alcyon has what it takes to understand the beauty of her love, after all she isn't murdering her loved ones... these dolls are vessels that will immortalize the souls of her lovers and one day when she  has preserved the souls of all the potential lovers she has yet to meet she will join her lovers in eternal dollhood.<br><br>

        While Myrdin has lots of dolls, not all of them are occupied as she usually crafts her dolls during the dating phase, which means there's time for them to escape before she binds them. She can't bring herself to throw out these unfortunate  empty vessels, representing old flames that got away. These dolls become bittersweet reminders of fond memories for her.
