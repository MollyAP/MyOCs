    etymology:
      `<h1>Name</h1>
      <p>
      <strong>Cabría</strong><br> 
      <i>/ka.bree.ah/</i><br><br>

      The name "Cabría" comes from the Spanish word for "goat," which is "cabro" (masculine) and "cabra" (feminine). To fit the six letter rule I added an accent mark "í" to it making it "Cabrío," and "Cabría," and while Cabrío translates to "goatish,"  doing the same to "cabra" doesn't create a feminine form; instead, "Cabría" translates to "would fit." Despite this, I quite liked the sound of "Cabría," so that's what I chose to stick with as her first name.<br><br>

      <strong>Dionis</strong><br>
      <i>/dye.oh.niss/</i><br><br>

      Dionis comes  from a brand of goat milk skincare products. The founder named the brand after Dionis Beach in Nantucket, which, in turn, was named after Dionis Coffin, the wife of its original proprietor, Tristram Coffin, but the name Dionis itself is derived from Latin "Dionysus," A Greek deity associated with wine-making, orchards and fruit, vegetation, fertility, festivity, insanity, ritual madness, religious ecstasy, and theatre. Notably, the worship of Dionysus often involved the sacrifice of goats.

    biography:
      `<h1>Bio</h1>
    <p>
    Affectionately nicknamed Diodio by Amares, Cabría Aelius, formerly known as Cabría Dionis, is a skilled witch who has mastered the mystical arts of witchery under the guidance of La Brujota. While she specializes in creating poisons and toxins, her true passion lies in the art of candle making, earning her a stellar reputation among candle lovers and fellow chandlers alike.<br><br>

    Cabría harbors a deep-seated disdain for troll society, rejecting societal norms and choosing to live in the solitude of the forest, much like her fellow witches. Her training has made her less inclined to kindness, often offering her services only in exchange for money or tradable goods. She has a tendency to hold grudges, and those who cross her or fail to pay for her services can expect her revenge to come back tenfold. While she sees Amares as a "stupid thot whore," Cabría actually harbors a black crush on her, although sadly for her the feelings are not reciprocated.

    personality:
      `<h1>Personality</h1>
    <p>
    Cabría has a prickly and harsh personality, often appearing grumpy and upset with a no-nonsense attitude towards those who cross her or do not meet her expectations. She is extremely confident in her skills as a witch and has good reason to, being a fierce and highly skilled pyrokinetic she actually has the power to back up her abrasive personality. Despite this she has a fierce loyalty to and love of her mentor La Brujota and feels a slight kinship between herself and her fellow witches.<br><br>

    She is not one to hold back her opinions or not speak her mind, often coming across as a know-it-all and purposefully antagonistic to people who don't mindlessly follow or look up to her and her beloved mentor. Cabría can be somewhat vulnerable though a trait only seen when she's with her crush and childhood rival, Amares, who she begrugingly allows to call her "Diodio" a reference to her former surname. She has a black crush on Amares but to her dismay Amares can not feel black emotions, only seeing her as a little sister. She is also fiercely independent, preferring to rely on her own skills and not ask for help from anyone but her mentor.<br><br>

    She has a distaste for her own ancestor, who was a benevolent and charitable witch much preferring the cold and uncaring Ancestor of Amares shown by the fact that she went as far as taking her surname. She doesn't even know what magic her ancestor practiced assuming it was only fire magic as she has no interest in her or her teachings taking on poisoncraft instead.
